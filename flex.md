# Flex Layout

The Flex Layout aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container,
even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic. (thus the word "flex").

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container ability to alter items width/height and order to best fill the
available space.(mostly to accommodate to all kinds of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill avaliable free space or
shrinks to prevent overflow.

Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which)
